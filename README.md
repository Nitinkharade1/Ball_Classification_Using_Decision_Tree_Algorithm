# Machine Learning Case Study: Ball Classification Using Decision Tree Algorithm.  

This project is a Machine Learning case study that focuses on classifying balls into two categories: tennis balls and cricket balls. The goal is to demonstrate how the Decision Tree algorithm can effectively distinguish between these two types of balls based on their characteristics.

## Overview

Tennis balls and cricket balls are distinct in terms of their size, weight, and surface texture. This project aims to develop a Decision Tree model that can accurately classify an unknown ball as either a tennis ball or a cricket ball based on its attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of various features and labels for a collection of tennis and cricket balls. Features may include measurements like:

- Circumference
- Weight
- Surface texture

The labels indicate whether each ball is a tennis ball or a cricket ball.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `src/`: Python source code for the Decision Tree model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python libraries and dependencies required for running the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ball-classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd ball-classification
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Decision Tree model from the `src/` directory to classify tennis balls and cricket balls.

## Model Evaluation

The Decision Tree model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

The results of the evaluation are presented in the source code files.
